= Pin mappings for Milk-V Duo

I received a new RISC-V-based board from Milk-V and started using this library to work with GPIO: https://github.com/warthog618/gpiod.
Apparently, the naming scheme in Duo is different from those used in RPi and Banana Pi for which the pin mappings are provided.

I created this tiny module to support Milk-V Duo mappings.
It's not required to be part of the `gpiod` module so it can be imported separately.
See the example below.

== Pin naming in Milk-V Duo

In this board there are 5 GPIO chips (`gpiochip0` to `gpiochip4`).
The pins are named like `GPIOA14`, `GPIOC9`, or `PWR_GPIO21` and they are served by different chips.
In this case the names above would be translated to `gpiochip0` + offset 14, `gpiochip2` + offset 9,
and `gpiochip4` + offset 21 respectively.

== Example


[source,go]
----
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"
	"os/signal"
	"syscall"
	"time"

	milkvduo "github.com/pavelanni/gpiod-milkvduo"
	"github.com/warthog618/gpiod"
)

func main() {
	pin := "PWR_GPIO21" // this could be "GPIOA14" or "GPIOC9"
	lineId, err := milkvduo.PinLineID(pin)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	l, err := gpiod.RequestLine(lineId.Chip, lineId.Offset, gpiod.AsOutput())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

// The rest is the same: you set the line's value, etc.
}
